        <p>
          Investing in start-ups and early-stage businesses involves risks,
          including illiquidity, lack of dividends, loss of investment and
          dilution, and it should be done only as part of a diversified
          portfolio. invistor is targeted exclusively at investors who are
          sufficiently sophisticated to understand these risks and make their
          own investment decisions. You will only be able to invest via invistor
          once you are registered as sufficiently sophisticated.
